# Create a class DictionarySearcher which takes a dictionary and contains methods that perform searches on it.

# Next, allow the user to perform one of four types of searches:

	# Exact matches
	# Partial matches
	# "begins with" matches
	# "ends with" matches
		# These can be done with Regex or not... you should use whatever you're least comfortable with! The results should return the full word, regardless of match type.

	# Once the search is complete, display the number of matches and those matches:
		# 1 exact: 2 partial 3 begins with 4 ends with
		# enter search termn
			# display number of matches

			#Play with this and verify that searches and saving works properly. What other search types can you come up with?
